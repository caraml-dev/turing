# Update Router

To update a router, you would need to call `update` on a `Router` object with a `RouterConfig` as an argument:

```python
# 4. Update the router with the new router config
my_router.update(my_router_config)
```

The returned value would be the updated `Router` itself (in this example we are not assigning the return value to 
any variable).
