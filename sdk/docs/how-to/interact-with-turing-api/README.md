# Interacting with Turing API

Turing SDK interacts with 12 main API endpoints of Turing API. Usage of each of these endpoints are demonstrated in 
each subsection, with each page being numbered according to the order in which these endpoints are used in the 
sample provided [here](https://github.com/gojek/turing/tree/main/sdk/samples).
