# Turing Experimentation Concepts

## Terminology

* **Experiment** - The set of configurations, filters and methodologies that allow for systematically varying some independent variables to impact some other dependent variables, through the Turing system.
* **Experiment Engine** - A system that is responsible for managing experiment configurations and running them.
* **Experiment Variables** - Input values that have an impact on the 'Treatment' generated by the Experiment Engine. These are retrieved from the incoming request header or payload and applied when running the experiment.
* **'Running' an Experiment** - Generating a Treatment for the given variables, by processing the Turing Experiment.
* **Client** - In Experiment Engines that implement access control, someone with appropriate permissions to run an experiment.
* **Variant** - A set of static configurations (as with A/B experiments), that would be selected at random, to be applied to the current request.
* **Treatment** - The configuration to be applied to the current request. This may be one of the static Variants, if exists, or dynamically generated (as in the case of experiment engines like PlanOut).

## Workflow

When creating a router, Turing users may choose to configure an experiment on an available experiment engine (the [Developer Guide](./developer_guide.md) has info on adding experiment engines to Turing). When the router is deployed, with every incoming request to the router, a call will be made to the experiment engine using the following information.
* Experiment related configurations supplied by the user at the time of router version creation (such as authentication credentials for the engine)
* Experiment Variables (described in the [Terminology](##Terminology) section) - during router configuration, the user should indicate how these values should be parsed from the request.

The response from the experiment engine will be passed to the Ensembling phase, along with the response from each model route.
