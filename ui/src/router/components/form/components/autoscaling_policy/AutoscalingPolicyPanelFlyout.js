            The Autoscaling Policy defines the condition for increasing or decreasing the number of
            replicas, for users that require granular control over the behavior. Currently, 4 metrics
            are supported: Concurrency, RPS, CPU and Memory. <b>Concurrency</b> is the default metric,
            with a target value of <b>1</b>.
          </p>

          <h3>Guidelines for tuning the Autoscaling Target</h3>

          <p>
            For most users, the default values should suffice.
            For more advanced users, the following guidelines may be useful in tuning the autoscaling parameters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>RPS:</b> Suitable if a single replica has been tested to perform well up to a given RPS.
              Users can deploy a single replica with a reasonable CPU/Memory configuration, slowly increase the
              request rate to the deployment to determine the boundary at which the performance begins to dip.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Concurrency:</b> A process similar to RPS described above may be followed to tune the target value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>CPU / Memory:</b> These can be chosen according to whether the process is CPU bound
              or memory bound. With this, scale to 0 is not supported. CPU and Memory are specified in
              terms of the % utilization of the requested value (Eg: 75 indicates 75%).
            </li>
          </ul>
