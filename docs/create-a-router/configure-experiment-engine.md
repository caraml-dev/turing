# Configure Experiment Engine

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is **optional** and the default behaviour will be to send the request to all of the configured routes, but the response from Turing will depend on the Ensembler configuration.
{% endhint %}

If you intend to determine how to select/combine responses from the individual routes (typically in the Ensembler) to send back as the Turing response, configure the Experiment Engine as shown in Configure Experiment Engine.
