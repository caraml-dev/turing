# Deleting a Router Version

Any version that is not currently deployed or in the process of deployment can be deleted. This action will remove the version from the routerâ€™s history and can no longer be accessed.  

Navigate to the Router Details View of your router.

Click on the History tab.

Only a version that is **not currently deployed** (indicated by the absence of the `Deployed` status) can be deleted. If you would like to see the details of your router version before deleting, proceed to Deleting a Router Version from Version Details View. If not, click on the Delete button of the version you would like to delete in the Actions column.
