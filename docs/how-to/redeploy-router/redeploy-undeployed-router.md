# Redeploy an undeployed router

Navigate to the Router Details View of your router.

Click on the More Actions button and select Redeploy router. 

Only an **undeployed** router (indicated by the router status `Not deployed`) can be redeployed and Turing will automatically redeploy the most recently deployed version for you. If you want to deploy a different version, proceed to Redeploy a Valid Version.

Once the router is in the process of redeployment, you will see that the status of your router has changed from `Not deployed` to `Updating`.
