# Deleting Ensembler

An ensembler can only be deleted if it is not in active use by any routers or ensembling jobs. Deleting such an ensembler will result in the purging of all related inactive router versions and ensembling jobs, as well as the ensembler metadata from the Turing database. This action is **irreversible**.
