# Deleting an Ensembler with related inactive entities

This page describes the process of deleting of ensemblers **with related inactive entities** (ensembling jobs and/or router versions).

Deleting the ensembler will also delete any inactive entities related to the ensembler.

Navigate to the Ensemblers page. Click on the delete button:

The related router versions and the ensembling jobs shown in the dialog will get deleted together with the ensembler since they are inactive:

Type the ensembler's name in the text bar to confirm your decision:

Once the specified ensembler has been successfully deleted, you will no longer be able to see the ensembler on the Ensemblers page:
